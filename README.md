# Podcast Link Generator

Transform your podcast transcripts into rich, authoritative resource lists. This tool automatically identifies key topics discussed in your episode and generates high-quality outbound links, making it the perfect companion for creating comprehensive show notes.

## ✨ Features

### 🎙️ Intelligent Transcript Analysis
Paste full transcripts—complete with timestamps and speaker names—to identify the most relevant subjects. The tool handles long-form text and filters out the "fluff" to find the real value.

### 🔍 Authority Link Generation
Automatically search for and generate links to reputable sources, articles, and references related to your podcast topics. 

### ⚙️ Customizable Extraction
* **Topic Scaling:** Choose exactly how many resources you want to find (from 1 to 10+).
* **Domain Filtering:** Blacklist specific websites (like your own or competitors) to ensure a diverse range of external resources.
* **Topic Exclusion:** Prevent specific "inside jokes" or irrelevant recurring themes from appearing in your resource list.

### 🛠️ Show Note Optimization
Designed specifically for podcasters and producers to bridge the gap between a spoken conversation and a helpful resource page for their audience.

### 🧪 Integrated Link Tester
A built-in developer tool to verify the health and relevance of generated links before you publish them to your website.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Configure:** Add your API keys for search and processing.
2.  **Input:** Paste your raw podcast transcript into the text area.
3.  **Refine:** Set your "Avoid" lists to filter out unwanted sites or topics.
4.  **Process:** Click "Process Transcript" to generate a curated list of authoritative links.
5.  **Publish:** Copy the results directly into your show notes or blog post.
